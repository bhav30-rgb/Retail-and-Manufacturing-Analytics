Other countries like the UK, Germany, France, and Canada lag behind.

💡 Recommendations to Boost Sales

1. Product Focus: Invest more in expanding the bike sub-categories that are high-performing (e.g., Road Bikes, Mountain Bikes). Re-evaluate inventory of low-selling products like Helmets and Tires.

2. Customer Targeting:
Prioritize the ₹60K–₹80K income group with customized offers.
Segment promotions by gender as both have nearly equal purchase behavior.

3. Regional Strategy:
Double down on strong markets (US, Australia).
Launch regional campaigns to improve sales in Europe and Canada.

4. Category Optimization:
Consider bundling accessories with bike sales to improve underperforming categories.
Phase out or redesign clothing lines that aren’t contributing significantly to revenue.
